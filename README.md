Madhu Parvathaneni alias MS is a Solutions Architect and mentor at Make Skilled. He has 10+ years of experience in building IoT products from prototype stage to production stage. He trained more than 1.8 lakh students and 10K+ faculties across India on various cutting-edge technologies like IoT, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Augmented and Virtual Reality, Robotics, Blockchain etc...

# Steps

1. Interface DHT11 with ESP32
2. Program ESP32 Device using Arduino
3. Broadcast this Data to All FDP Participants
4. Create Dataset by FDP Participants
5. Apply Machine Learning on Dataset
6. Implementation of Machine Learning on ESP32 Edge Device
